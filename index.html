                            <p> A Haiku is a form of short poetry that originated in Japan. The traditional
                                Haiku contains 3 phrases with a total of 17 <i>on</i>, which in English translates to
                                the 5-7-5 rule denoting the number of syllables on each line. However, Kerouac believed

                                famously saying <q>you got </q>.
